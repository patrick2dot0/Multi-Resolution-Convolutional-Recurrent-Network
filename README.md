# Multi-Resolution-Convolutional-Recurrent-Network

In this repo, we implemented a new sequential model called multi-resolution convolutional recurrent network (MRCRN), which is a hybrid of TCNs and RNNs. Utilizing the representation learned by a TCN in different layers, RNN can capture context with different window size without modifying the architecture. Eventually, we show a significant improvements on language modeling and action recognition to support our arguments.
